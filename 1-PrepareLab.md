Before you can run all the labs about container orchestration, you should prepare your environment to execute those labs. Check the following instructions.


# Task 1. IBM Cloud registration

Labs are running on the **IBM Cloud** (ex Bluemix).

So before you can start any labs, you should have satisfied the following prerequisites :
- [ ] You should have **1 valid email** 

- [ ] Sign up to the **IBM Cloud** 


**If you already have a IBM id, jump to task 2.**

> If you don't have a valid email address or you don't want to use your personal or professional email address, then you can use https://temp-mail.org/en/

This web site will give you a temporary email address for 10 minutes :

![image-20190118103132743](images/image-20190118103132743-7803892.png)

From that screen,  you can use this temporaty email address (cugebezaza@utooemail.com for example) for the time to register to the IBM Cloud. 

### Sign in to IBM Cloud
If you don't have already registered to **IBM Cloud**,  
Open this link  [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) or type https://cloud.ibm.com/ in your favorite internet browser.


![image-20190118101459166](images/image-20190118101459166-7802899.png)

### Fill in the form
Specify last name, first name, country, phone number and password.
> By **default**, all new people that register to IBM Cloud will have an **Lite Account** with **no time restriction**. This is not a 30 day trial account. 

Click on **Create Account** button.

![image-20190118103712268](images/image-20190118103712268-7804232.png) 


Then if everything is fine, you will receive the following page:

![Thanks](./images/a003.png)


### Confirm your registration to IBM Cloud from your inbox
From your email application , you should have received an email from the IBM Cloud:

![image-20190118103917487](images/image-20190118103917487-7804357.png)

Click on the link to confirm the account:

![image-20190118104115473](images/image-20190118104115473-7804475.png)

Log in to IBM Cloud with your credentials :

![Success Sign up](./images/a005.png)

Then type your password and click **Continue**

![image-20190118104305743](images/image-20190118104305743-7804585.png)

Type your password and click Login button:

![image-20190118104419179](images/image-20190118104419179-7804659.png)

You should see the following **Dashboard**:

![image-20190118104520085](images/image-20190118104520085-7804720.png)

You are now connected (and registred) to the IBM Cloud.

> IMPORTANT : Take a note of your email address and your password.


# Task 2. Apply a promo code (if necessary)

Check if you can access to **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters**.
To do so, click on **Catalog** and click on **Containers** on the left pane of the page :


![Showing Containers](./images/showcontainers.png)

> **IMPORTANT** : If you just see **Container Registry** and not the Containers in Kubernetes Clusters, then **you will need a promo code !!!**

> **IMPORTANT** : If you don't have a **promo code**, then ask IBM during the workshop. You can continue the other steps of this preparation and come back later to this step. However, to create a cluster, you will need a promo code.

To install a promo code, follow the procedure : 

Go to **Manage >Account > Account Settings** and press enter.


![image-20190118112618467](images/image-20190118112618467-7807178.png)

You should get the following section in the **account setting page**  :

![image-20190118112743476](images/image-20190118112743476-7807263.png)

Click **Apply Code** button.


![image-20190118112849245](images/image-20190118112849245-7807329.png)

Enter your **promo code** and click **Apply** 

![Apply Promo Code](./images/applypromo2.png)

> Close this window and **logout / login** to your account.

Go back to the **Catalog** and check that now you have access to **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters** and the Container Registry.

![Kubernetes](./images/kcheck.png)

# Task 3. Install Docker Desktop on your Mac

Follow this procedure to install the latest Docker Desktop (ex Community Edition) on your Mac (**for Windows**, jump to the next session) 

Docker Desktop for Mac is favailable for free.

https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac

![image-20190118113648920](images/image-20190118113648920-7807808.png)

Click on the blue button **Please Login to Download**. If you are not registred to the Docker site, then create an account. Then when you are registered and logged in, click on the **Get Docker ** button.

![image-20190118113959736](images/image-20190118113959736-7807999.png)

Double-click **Docker.dmg** to start the install process.

When the installation completes and Docker starts, the whale in the top status bar shows that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

![Docker for Mac is ready](./images/install2docker.png)

Open a terminal and type :

`docker version`

You should see something similar to this screen :
```console

# Task 6. Install the ibmcloud commands

The **ibmcloud** command line interface (CLI) provides a set of commands that are grouped by namespace for users to interact with IBM Cloud. In previous versions, the name of that command was "bluemix" or "bx".

You install a set of IBM Cloud commands and tools, verify the installation, and configure your environment. IBMÂ® Cloud developer tools offer a command-line approach to creating, developing, and deploying end-to-end web, mobile, and microservice applications.

For MacOS or Linux (run as root) :
`curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash`

For Windows in PowerShell (run as Administrator - your system will be rebooted at the end of installation) : 

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
```

Results:

```console

# Task 7. Login to IBM Cloud

For these labs, we have decided to login to the **London Data Center** (api.eu-gb.bluemix.net). 

Login to IBM Cloud with the ibmcloud command :

 `ibmcloud login -a api.eu-gb.bluemix.net`

 And answer a few questions: email, password :

```console
> ibmcloud login -a api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
API endpoint: api.eu-gb.bluemix.net

Email> cugebezaza@utooemail.com

- Use 'ibmcloud cf' if you want to run the Cloud Foundry CLI with current IBM Cloud CLI context.

```



And optionally, you can also specify the following ORG and SPACE with that command :

`ibmcloud target -o cugebezaza@utooemail.com -s dev`

or 

`ibmcloud target --cf`

Results:

 ```console
